reosdep install step will take a while (~15-30 minutes)
I ran into an error on that step at first, also. I am sure that I messed up my workspace in
several ways ways trying to figure things out and install all the necessary stuff.
I ultimately created a fresh empty second catkin workspace to install moveit into, which did allow it to do its thing.
I then moved the other things to this second workspace and now it is building without errors.
In short, I don't fully unbderstand what was going wrong, but my solution seems to have been sufficient so far.

source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
wstool init src
wstool merge -t src https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros-planning/moveit/master/moveit.rosinstall
wstool update -t src
rosdep install -y --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro ${ROS_DISTRO}
catkin config --extend /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO} --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
sudo apt install ccache
echo 'export PATH=/usr/lib/ccache:$PATH' >> $HOME/.bashrc
source $HOME/.bashrc
catkin build
