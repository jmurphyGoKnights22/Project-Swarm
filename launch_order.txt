All ROSLAUNCH and ROSRUN should be in separate terminals (1 for each rosrun and 1 for each roslaunch)

roslaunch Project-Swarm start_world.launch
roslaunch Project-Swarm multi_quadrotor_2d.launch
roslaunch Project-Swarm multi_slam_2d.launch
roslaunch Project-Swarm multi_move_base_2d.launch

(Lift Both Robots To Different Altitudes Using These TeleOp Commands)
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py cmd_vel:=/uav1/cmd_vel
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py cmd_vel:=/uav2/cmd_vel
(Now hold T for a few seconds to move bot up and press G to stop it, ensure all drones are on different altitudes)
